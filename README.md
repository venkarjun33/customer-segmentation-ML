# customer-segmentation-ML

In this project, machine learning algorithms are employed to identify patterns and relationships within the data, helping to automate the process of customer segmentation. Common techniques include clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, or machine learning models like decision trees and neural networks. The goal is to create meaningful segments that share common characteristics, such as purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences.

By implementing customer segmentation through machine learning, businesses can enhance their targeted marketing efforts, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation. This approach enables more personalized interactions with customers, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
